As a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, my focus is on leveraging Android Framework and Web Development skills to drive technological innovation. At Michigan State University, I'm immersed in a Computer Science program that shapes my analytical and technical competencies, enriching the advanced projects our team engages with.

My role in Student Outreach at MSU encapsulates my commitment to community and growth. This dedication is mirrored in my co-founding of EwebBuild, where we empowered local businesses in India with web solutions, reflecting a 99% customer satisfaction score. It's this blend of technical acumen and customer-centric values that I bring to my current endeavors.
